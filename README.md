Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my data science projects, highlighting my skills and expertise across various topics and domains. Each project demonstrates proficiency in using diverse tools and languages including Python, SQL, R, and more.

## Projects

- [Movie Database EDA](https://github.com/dmydud/movie-database-eda): Analyzed the extensive MovieLens dataset using **PostgreSQL** for insights into user ratings, tags, and movie preferences. Leveraged **SQL** for data querying and analysis, alongside **Tableau** for visualization. The database setup was simplified using **Docker** to run a PostgreSQL container.
